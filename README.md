# Overview

This reports presents my project from the course Applied Iot from Linnaeus University. This report will cover a wide range of topics necessary to building your own device, such as the materials needed, the code making it work and finally how to send and receive data.

This project is not that long nor that difficult to perform, so the average time to complete should be around 3-5 hours depending on prior knowledge when it comes to programming.

# Objective

The objective of this project is to use a microcontroller to measure different types of values, such as temperature, humidity and magnetic field data. The goal of this project is to measure more values than your traditional thermometer and being able to view the data in another location through Adafruit.
